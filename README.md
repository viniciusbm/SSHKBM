# SSHKBM
A small utility to control mouse and keyboard over SSH

I wrote this just as a quick way to send simple keyboard and mouse events to another computer using SSH.

It is **not** intended to be used for complex tasks or text editing, and it is **not** guaranteed to work on all Linux distributions and versions.
Some keys may not work as expected.
